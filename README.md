# subl-autosave-plugin
## Sublime Text plugin for autosaving open files in a given folder.

The idea is that the folder, specified in `~/darth_sublime_insync`, is being synced by any cloud storage client, e.g. Google Drive, OneDrive, Insync, DropBox, so that every tab created in Sublime Text in your current computer will be given a default name and saved in the cloud by Insync and readily available accross all your computers.

You create an empty tab, fill it with quick data you need, and as soon as it loses focus, this plugin will check for `~/darth_sublime_insync`, get the folder path that points to the folder you already sync to the cloud, for example `~/Insync/dav.cardoso@gmail.com/Google Drive/Work` where Work is the folder being synced from my Google Drive, and then specifies a project name that you can change whenever you're in a new project/task. That's it, every tab that is not empty, but it is also not saved, will be saved, without ever asking you for a file name. It will be saved `~/Insync/dav.cardoso@gmail.com/Google Drive/Work/{project_name}/subl_yyymmdd_hhmmss.txt`.
